OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Strokes are a leading cause of disability and death globally according to the W.H.O. Over 9% of victims are initially misdiagnosed which increases to 24% - 60% when symptoms are transient. Early detection saves lives and reduces long-term complications. Manual risk assessment is time-consuming and error-prone.

The objective of the project is to develop and evaluate a ML-based classification model to predict stroke risk accurately and efficiently by identifying most significant factors for stroke risk.
